## 🧠 Product Vision (Co-Founder Notes)

The full loop that makes ClosetEye special:

```
📸 Photo anything (worn / on bed / store shelf)
    ↓ AI extracts the garment
    ↓ Placed on YOUR body model
    ↓ Mix with clothes you own OR clothes you're considering
    ↓ AI scores the outfit + suggests what to buy
    ↓ Track cost per wear, style DNA, capsule score
```

**What makes this viral:**
- Body model from YOUR photo (not a generic mannequin)
- Try on clothes you haven't bought yet — mix with what you own
- Capsule Score gamification — people will obsess over improving it
- Cost Per Wear — data people love to share
- OOTD habit loop — daily engagement, high retention
